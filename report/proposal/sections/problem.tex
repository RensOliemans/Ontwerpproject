\section{Problem}
The University of Twente has approximately 1500 Wi-Fi Access Points (\emph{WAPs}), and the configuration of those points are kept in Excel. This makes it rather difficult to move these WAPs around, since every change has to be manually entered. Coupled with a need for a lot of changes - replacements of WAPs, moving them around, rebuilding and maintenance of buildings -, a more modular and easily accessible program is preferred. Specifically, a program with a user-friendly graphical user interface, where the end-user can use their mouse to easily move, remove or add WAPs to the UT buildings.
